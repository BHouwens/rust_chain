/**
 * ChainState stores and provides an API to update our local knowledge of the
 * current best chain and header tree.
 *
 * It generally provides access to the current block tree, as well as functions
 * to provide new data, which it will appropriately validate and incorporate in
 * its state as necessary.
 *
 * Eventually, the API here is targeted at being exposed externally as a
 * consumable libconsensus library, so any functions added must only call
 * other class member functions, pure functions in other parts of the consensus
 * library, callbacks via the validation interface, or read/write-to-disk
 * functions (eventually this will also be via callbacks).

     * walk this set and check if a new header is a descendant of something in
     * this set, preventing us from having to walk mapBlockIndex when we try
     * to connect a bad block and fail.
     *

     * from an invalid block as invalid at the time we discover it to be
     * invalid, doing so would require walking all of mapBlockIndex to find all
     * descendants. Since this case should be very rare, keeping track of all
     * BLOCK_FAILED_VALID blocks in a set should be just fine and work just as
     * well.
     *
     * Because we already walk mapBlockIndex in height-order at startup, we go
     * ahead and mark descendants of invalid blocks as FAILED_CHILD at that time,
     * instead of putting things in this set.
